// with call() an object can use a method belonging to another object

// .call() is a method that allows you to call a function with a specific this value â€” meaning, you can control what this refers to when the function runs.


// Why use .call()?

//     Borrow methods from one object and use them with another

//     Set the value of this manually

//     Useful for function reuse and functional programming tricks
